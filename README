This is an example of the the Keynote API in Perl.

Currently the code requires a fixed API Key. If you don't know what this is... go to api.keynote.com for additional details.

The code will accept as input a list of slots to define the scope of the data extract. The i/p file must be slotid's 
associated with the fixed Key and must be entered one slot per line. If NO slot input is provided, all slots associated
with the API Key will be sampled.

The code uses XML::SIMPLE to parse the XML output of the API query. In addition, the code makes use of LWP::SIMPLE
for HTTP communication w/api.keynote.com. See inline for additional Perl extensions.

The main focus of this example is to allow a Keynote customer to define Availability metrics and track specific errors 
externally of the Keynote reporting tools. The primary output is a CSV file with specific error codes as reported
by the Keynote monitoring infrastructure. This module is expected to run hourly (as the default extract period 
during development was 3600 seconds).
